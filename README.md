# <img src="assets/dressage_logo.png" alt="Dressage logo" width="96" align="absmiddle" /> Dressage: Scalable RL for Any Agent and Sandbox


**Dressage** is an agentic reinforcement learning training framework built on top of [slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime). It bridges the gap between policy rollouts, sandboxed tool execution, and training data conversion through a shared proxy and paddock layer.

Dressage lets you train diverse types of LLM agents that use real tools — like code editors, shell commands, file I/O, retrieval APIs — with full RL gradient flow. Both **whitebox** (Python tool loops) and **blackbox** (HTTP agents like `opencode` / `openclaw`) paradigms are supported through a unified interface.

## 📢 News

- **[2026/06/30]**  Released [whitebox agent training curves](dressage/recipes/README.md) and [true staleness control](docs/staleness.md).
- **[2026/06/20]**  **Dressage is now open source!**


## 💡 Technical Highlights

Dressage introduces several key innovations for agentic RL:

### Any Agent, Any Sandbox

Dressage separates agent semantics from execution placement. Whitebox Python tool loops, blackbox HTTP agents such as `opencode` / `openclaw`, local bubblewrap pools, and remote E2B sandboxes all converge on the same proxy-to-training path.

### Token-Wise Control

Dressage records training evidence at token granularity: `token_id`, `logprob`, `loss_mask`, `token_version`, and `token_expert`. **TITO — Token-In-Token-Out** avoids retokenization drift by encoding only each turn's append delta and splicing token IDs incrementally.

The same token-wise model powers Token-Boundary Pause/Resume through `GenerationController`, version-aware masking through `token_version`, and MoE **Routing Replay (R3)** through `token_expert`. See [Training Layer](docs/training.md) for the deep dive.

### Segment-Aware Training

When trajectories split because of history compaction or tool-schema changes, Dressage expands **every** segment into a training sample and broadcasts the anchor segment's terminal advantage to its siblings. Shared `rollout_id` / `parent_traj_id` values keep segments in the same slime training step, while prompt-equal denominators prevent split-heavy trajectories from receiving extra gradient weight, please refer to [Training Layer](docs/training.md).

### Slime-Native Integration

Dressage is built on slime, not maintained as a fork. Rollout generation, reward processing, sample conversion, and training behavior plug into upstream slime through dotted import-path hooks.

### Production-Grade Rollout Safety

Atomic trajectory logging, HTTP error redaction, context overflow detection, session artifact archiving, and abort safety contracts keep failed rollouts diagnosable without corrupting training data.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Dressage's architecture is built on an elegant separation of concerns across three orthogonal axes. The entire system sits on top of slime as a git submodule, extending it through dotted import-path customization hooks — no upstream fork required.

![Dressage architecture overview](assets/artchitecture.png)

Compact mental model:

- **Dressage owns the agentic RL bridge**: rollout hooks create sessions, the proxy records token-level evidence, and the training layer converts trajectories into slime-ready samples.
- **Paddocks own interaction semantics**: whitebox paddocks run Python tool loops; blackbox paddocks delegate to HTTP agents through BlackboxServer.
- **Sandboxes own placement and isolation**: the same rollout path can target local bubblewrap slots or remote E2B sandboxes without changing the agent logic.
- **Slime owns the training substrate**: Megatron training, Ray rollout orchestration, and SGLang inference stay upstream and are customized through import-path hooks.

The key insight: **paddock mode** (whitebox vs blackbox) and **sandbox provider** (local vs remote) are orthogonal axes — mix and match freely.
The sandbox layer now exposes provider-neutral `SandboxSpec`, `SandboxLease`, and service endpoints; paddocks create and terminate leases while blackbox rollouts resolve the `blackbox` service endpoint from the lease.

Both whitebox and blackbox agent scaffolds converge on the same post-rollout path:

```text
proxy.finalize_session → trajectory/read → expand_segments_to_samples → list[Sample]
```

### End-to-End Rollout Flow

```text
1️⃣  Generate hook creates a paddock lease + proxy session
2️⃣  Agent runs (whitebox Python loop or blackbox HTTP agent)
3️⃣  Each LLM call goes through Proxy → SGLang; tokens recorded per step
4️⃣  Session finalizes into one or more trajectory segments
5️⃣  Segments expand to training Samples; reward + loss hooks prepare train_data
```

Core modules map onto the main runtime layers:

### [Inference Proxy](docs/proxy.md): Token-Level Trajectory Recording

OpenAI-compatible HTTP service that sits between agent rollouts and the SGLang inference router. Every LLM call passes through it — every token, logprob, and loss mask is captured for training. Agents never call SGLang directly. Supports per-step recording, auto-segmentation on history rewrites, preemptible generation via `GenerationController`, weight version tracking, and MoE routing replay. The central nervous system of trajectory recording.

### [Paddock](docs/paddock.md): Unified Environment Interaction

Single-class abstraction that manages all environment interaction during rollouts — sandbox lease creation, agent/tool calls, pause/resume lifecycle, and cleanup. The "what-to-do" layer. `BlackboxPaddock` drives HTTP agents (`register_agent` → `call_agent` → `pause/resume`), while `WhiteboxPaddock` exposes `tool_call` for Python agents (shell, file read/write). Factory pattern: `create_paddock_from_env()` wires everything from environment variables.

### [Sandbox Backends](docs/sandbox.md): Pluggable Isolation

Two pluggable isolation backends, swapped via a single environment variable. **Local bubblewrap** (`local_bwrap`): Ray-managed pool of bubblewrap-isolated slots with supervisor health monitoring. **E2B** (`e2b`): elastic cloud-native sandboxes from E2B templates/images. Two local pool modes: `blackbox` (full BlackboxServer service endpoint) or `command_only` (shell/file ops). Local blackbox clusters can also be managed with the `dressage-local-blackbox-*` / `dressage-blackbox-*` scripts.

### [BlackboxServer](docs/blackbox-server.md): Unified HTTP Adapter

Bundled HTTP adapter service that decouples the rollout manager from concrete agentic backends. Sits inside sandboxes, manages exactly one backend agent process and one active session at a time, and transparently proxies all LLM calls back through the Dressage inference proxy. Supports `opencode`, `openclaw`, and future backends through a pluggable adapter pattern. Features turn idempotency, register-and-rebind, and background health monitoring.

### [Rollout Hooks](docs/rollout.md): Slime Integration

Bridges slime's RL training loop with Dressage's agentic capabilities through customizable hooks — all specified as dotted import paths, no fork required. Two generate paradigms: `whitebox_agent` (Python tool loops) and `blackbox_dispatch` (BlackboxServer delegation). Three async scheduling modes: sync, fully async (background worker pipelines), and partial async (early return on `global_batch_size`). Includes pluggable reward registry, prompt-equal sample conversion, and trajectory-level logging.

### [Training Layer](docs/training.md): Multi-Segment & TITO

Transforms proxy-recorded trajectories into slime-compatible training data. Multi-segment expansion trains on all segments (not just the last). TITO tokenization eliminates retokenization drift across turns. Prompt-equal gradient aggregation ensures fair scaling for GRPO. Partial rollout resume preserves in-flight generation across weight updates. Reward post-processing broadcasts anchor advantages to sibling segments.

### [Recipes](docs/recipes.md): Example Agents

Complete whitebox agent implementations demonstrating the framework. **ALFWorld**: TextWorld navigation agent with `env_step` tool for household task completion. **HotpotQA**: multi-hop retrieval agent with local FAISS+BGE index for complex question answering. Both include training scripts, reward functions, and a build-your-own guide for custom agents.

For the end-to-end data preparation and launch commands for these recipes, see the **[Whitebox Agent Quick Start](docs/whitebox-agent-quickstart.md)**.
